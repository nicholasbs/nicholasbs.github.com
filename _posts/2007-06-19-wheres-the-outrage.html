<p>I don't know how long this has been around, but I just stumbled upon it recently. The market-liberals<sup><a href="181note">[1]</a></sup> at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> have compiled <a href="http://www.cato.org/raidmap/">an interactive map of botched police raids</a>.<a title="181" name="181"></a> It appears to be both well-researched and thorough, and shows that the scourge of police invasions on innocents and nonviolent offenders is not limited to the years under the Bush administration.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cato's ideological brethren over at <em>Reason</em> have this <a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/120882.html">video interview</a> with Regina Kelly, who was wrongly arrested and jailed based upon a "tip" from a police informant. Ms. Kelly tells harrowing tale.</p>

	<li>This is, I believe, the label they prefer. For an interesting read, check out <a href="http://www.cato.org/about/about.html">How to Label Cato</a>, where they explain why they shouldn't be called a good number of other things.<a href="#181">↩</a></li>
