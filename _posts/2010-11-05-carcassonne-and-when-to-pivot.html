<p>I barely eked past <a href="http://twitter.com/cdixon">@cdixon</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/lethys">@lethys</a> for the coveted second-to-last place in a five-team game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)">Carcassonne</a> last night.</p><p>My strategy had been to make an early play for a central field, and then have a stake in one or two of the largest castles. Unfortunately, I didn't execute on this strategy well enough. I was one connecting tile away from getting two more followers onto the main field, which would have let me share the spoils of the biggest prize of the game.</p><p>What bothered me at the end was that I noticed that even if I had executed properly, my strategy wasn't a winning one. I'd have shot forward to second place, but I'd still have fallen short of victory.</p><p>It dawned on me when falling asleep last night that this scenario is exactly analogous to an instance of when you should pivot in a startup. If you're on a path that, even if you execute perfectly, you won't end up where you want to be, then you know it's time to pivot.</p>
