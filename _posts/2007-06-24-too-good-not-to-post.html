<p>One of the better policy initiatives I've seen in recent months:</p>
<blockquote> Steve Ahlenius, president of the McAllen Chamber of Commerce, sent out an e-mail to 140 media outlets nationwide Tuesday morning with the subject line: “McAllen, Texas calls for wall around Washington D.C.”</p><p>“We feel the need to protect ourselves from bad legislation, bad ideas and a waste of tax money,” Ahlenius wrote.</p><p>“A wall around their homes and businesses will give the legislators and Washington bureaucrats a better understanding of what kind of message this action will send.</p><p>“Let’s see if they decide to climb over it, tunnel under it, or walk over it.”</blockquote>
