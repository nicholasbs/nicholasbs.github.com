<p>People frequently ask how to find a cofounder. My first response is always that their cofounder should be someone they get along with and know well, like a friend. They usually respond by saying they've already tapped their friends and extended network, and everyone who's good is already doing something else, so they need to meet someone new. </p><p>This can work but assumes something that's almost certainly false. Namely, <strong>it assumes that it's easier to convince someone you don't know to join you than someone you do know</strong>. That would only be true if people like you less as they get to know you, which hopefully isn't the case. </p><p>You should assume the good people you don't know are much like the ones you do, and they all have other things they are or could be doing. </p><p>You'll need to convince them that throwing their lot in with you is better -- more profitable, more fun, more world-changing, whatever -- than doing something else. You're more likely to succeed at this if they already know you're a smart, hard-working and dependable person they respect and get along with.</p>
