<p>Doing a startup is like climbing a mountain. You usually only see the peak you're currently scaling, and it's rarely the summit. These sub-peaks are the milestones along the way. They're things like finding a cofounder, having hypotheses tested, launches, raising rounds, getting paying customers, and making important hires.</p><p>Before you hit each milestone, you'll tell yourself that when you reach it things will be different. That's true, but in reality, the victory felt when you scale a peak is fleeting. It's quickly replaced with the realization of the enormity of the next peak you face. As you ascend, the pressure increases.</p><p>Enjoy the vistas from the peaks you reach, look back over the terrain you've traversed, and then take pleasure in the challenges that lie ahead. They're your future, and startups would be boring and pointless without them.</p>
