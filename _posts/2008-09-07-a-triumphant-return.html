<p>After months of delays, false promises, and distractions, Unschooled is back.</p><p>Since I last posted, dear reader (readers, even?),Â  much has happened: I graduated from engineering school, started my first full-time job, and moved into a new apartment. There was more, of course, but this site has never been about the nitty-gritty details of my life, and just because I updated the banner graphic does not mean that is about to change.</p><p>For the curious, the resurrection of Unschooled was delayed in no small part by the fact that I spent more time geeking out than getting the site back online. I switched hosting providers twice -- from <a href="http://www.bluehost.com">bluehost</a> to <a href="http://vpslink.com/">VPSLink</a> to <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a>, where the site currently resides. I switched web servers twice -- from Apache to nginx back to Apache. And I switched blogging software three times -- from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> to <a href="http://byteflow.su/">Byteflow</a> to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> and back to WordPress, albeit a newer version. Needless to say, none of this was actually <em>necessary</em> in order to get the site back up and running.</p><p>So, despite my best efforts, the site <em>is</em> back, to which I can only say,</p><p>Welcome back.</p>
