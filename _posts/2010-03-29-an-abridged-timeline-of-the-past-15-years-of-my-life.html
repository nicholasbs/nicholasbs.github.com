<p><em>1995</em> - I founded my first company, CoolMan Inc., releasing a GameMaker adventure game called "The Quest v. 1.0" on AOL. Despite being terrible in virtually every respect, a thousand people downloaded it at keyword:file search.</p><p><em>1996</em> - I founded my second company, Lightning Productions. And by "founded," I mean I started listing it in the optional "company" field when filling out forms online. I got junk mail addressed to Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock, CEO, Lightning Productions for years.</p><p><em>199?</em> - Sometime in the late 90s, I decided  I wanted to start a real company some day.</p><p><em>199? - 200?</em> - I spend a bunch of time <a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">reading</a> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">about</a> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/love.html">startups</a> and <a href="http://paulgraham.com/die.html">entrepreneurship</a>.</p><p><em>2006</em> - I met <a href="http://dave.is">Dave</a> (previously known to me as "that guy who comes late to Signals &amp; Systems").</p><p><em>2007</em> - Dave and I decide to found a company together and start tossing around ideas.</p><p><em>2008</em> - Dave and I start having business meetings (i.e., walking around New York talking). Some friends don't think we're actually serious about this.</p><p><em>2009</em> - Dave and I start evaulating ideas more seriously. We consider everything from peer-to-peer psychotherapy to selling ice cream. We spend nearly six months exploring medical software, only to find our <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com/">favorite</a> <a href="http://newchoicehealth.com/">ideas</a> existed.</p><p><em>January 30</em> - During a brainstorming session led by my father, we developed a few more ideas that we really liked, and decided to iterate on each to see where they went.</p><p><em>March 1</em> - We decided to create a jobs website to match people with jobs they'll love.</p><p><em>March 3</em> - While starting to write a business plan, we decided to fill out a funding application on a whim.</p><p><em>March 5</em> - I tell work that I'll be leaving this summer to start a company, regardless of if we get funding. Most people think I'm crazy to leave a job I love in the middle of a down economy to start a company without any funding.</p><p><em>March 6</em> - We submit our application late.</p><p><em>March 14</em> - We receive a delightfully concise email saying they liked our application and want to meet in person.</p><p><em>Today, 10:50am</em> - We had a ridiculously fun interview.</p><p><em>Today, 5:35pm</em> - Funded.</p>
